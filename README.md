# Matplotlib Challenge

Objective: Create data visualizations using Matplotlib [technologies utilized: Pandas, Matplotlib]

Data: Physiological responses of mice from different types of drug treatments (capomulin, infubinol, ketapril, placebo)

1. Analyze tumor volume changes over time for each treatment
2. Show the number of metastatic sites changing over time for each treatment
3. Calculate the number survival rate for each drug
4. Compare the total % tumor volume change for each drug across all 45 days
5. Write brief analysis on 3 key findings

<b> Conclusions: </b>

After the 45 days of treatment, mice that were treated with Capomulin showed the most decrease in tumor volume (19% decrease) while the other treatments showed an increase in tumor volume. 

Mice that were treated with Ketapril had the largest metastatic spread after the 45 days   

After the 45 days, Infubinol had a survival rate of below 40% (even lower than the survival rate for the placebo)
